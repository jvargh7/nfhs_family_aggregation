## Hypertension

1. 'Told had high BP on two or more occassions by ...' OR
2. SBP > 140 mmHg OR
3. DBP > 90 Hg

## Why is it important

1. Prevalence of hypertension is high and growing in India. Indians are at higher risk of cardiometabolic diseases at younger ages and lower BMIs.
2. Undiagnosed and/or uncontrolled hypertension is common and can result in CVD.
3. About 50% of Indians are between 18-49 years. It's important to diagnose and manage their hypertension to minimize loss of productivity and future healthcare expenditure.


## Heilmeier Catechism

1. What are we trying to do? - Identify how likely hypertension aggregates in Indian families
2. How is it done today? - Family history is used as a risk factor, but is it incorporated in Indian screening guidelines?
3. What is new in our approach? - First ever survey that collects objective data from everyone in household. Presents opportunity to characterize risk beyond traditional individual (age, sex, smoking) and household risk factors.
4. Who cares? - Patient to get screened if another member has it. Providers to screen if another household member has it.
5. What are the risks? - Hypertension status is not verified (can be transient) etc
6. How much will it cost? - Data is publicly available. Family-centered screening is a potential question for further cost-effectiveness research.


## Key Results

1. There were XXX,XXX households where more than one adult participated in NFHS-5. Of these, XX.X% had at least two adults who had hypertension.
2. Among adults 18 to 49 years, living with at least one adult with hypertension was associated with X.XX times higher prevalence of hypertension, relative to not living with an adult with hypertension.
3. Associations were/were not consistent across socio-demographic subgroups (sex, age category [18-29,30 and older], urban/rural, wealth quintile, schooling [none, primary, secondary, higher]).

## Other Questions

1. How does direct familial relationships predict co-occurence (e.g. mother/father versus wife/uncle/aunt)?
2. Does it matter if the other family member with hypertension is older/younger or male/female?
